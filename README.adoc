# Apache Camel Kafka Source Connector Test
Michael Genereux <mgenereu@gmail.com>

## Steps to Reproduce

. Download `camel-timer-kafka-connector-0.4.0-package.zip` (You can find a list with links to latest version here: https://camel.apache.org/camel-kafka-connector/latest/connectors.html
).
    
    wget https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/camel/kafkaconnector/camel-timer-kafka-connector/0.4.0/camel-timer-kafka-connector-0.4.0-package.zip
    
. Unzi it.

    unzip camel-timer-kafka-connector-0.4.0-package.zip

. Create docker image `fdd`.

    docker build -t fdd .
    
. Run container.
    
    docker run --rm -p 2181:2181 -p 3030:3030 -p 8081-8083:8081-8083 -p 9581-9585:9581-9585 -p 9092:9092 -e CONNECT_PLUGIN_PATH=/connectors fdd

. Wait for the services to start up.  Takes about two minutes.

. Go to browser control panel at http://localhost:3030/kafka-connect-ui/[http://localhost:3030/kafka-connect-ui/].

. Click the _New_ button.

. Click _CamelTimerSourceConnector_.

. Use these properties:

    connector.class=org.apache.camel.kafkaconnector.timer.CamelTimerSourceConnector
    camel.source.path.timerName=test
    tasks.max=1
    topics=test
    value.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter
    key.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter

. Click _Create_.

. We hope that the connector will not fail.

. Click the _CamelTimerSourceConnector_.

. Click the box after _Tasks_.

. If you inspect _test_ topic you will find empty meaaseges, one ever each second, that is expected.

## Notes

* I'm not trying to get the Camel Timer actually perform correcly. It doesn't seem to matter what properties I provide the connector on creation.

* I was unable to get just taking the multi jar package from `https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/camel/kafkaconnector/camel-timer-kafka-connector/0.4.0/camel-timer-kafka-connector-0.4.0-package.tar.gz` and dropping into a directory under `/connectors`. I saw this method from a https://youtu.be/7Co2AN_AoM4[YouTube video] by https://github.com/hguerrero[Hugo Guerrero]. It would load into the Kafka Connect UI but running it would complain that it couldn't find supporting JARs on Camel Context creation.  I even tried adding `/connectors/camel-timer-kafka-connector/*` to the CLASSPATH and confirmed that the JARs were visible via JConsole/JMX. The fat jar was my workaround for this.
